# 2024-04-15 Share project files to people without Quickbyte accounts

There's been explicit demand for being able to share media with people who don't have Quickbyte accounts. This is a feature that was inevitable, but I had not yet gotten the time to work on it.

This is the current status of file sharing on Quickbyte:

- The "Quick transfer" feature let's you upload and share files via a download link. Anyone with that download link can download the files that were uploaded as part of that transfer. You can download the files individually or download all files as a zip. You cannot play videos/audios or preview images.
- You can invite people to your project. Anyone invited to a project can see the files in that project. You can play media and view images. You can download files individually, but not multiple files at once. The invited user has to login to be able to access the files.

The problems are obvious. There are two ways to share files. These two approaches are incompatible (i.e. currently no way to publicly share project files and no way to add "quick transfer" files to a project).

Eventually these two features should be unified:
- It should be possible to play media when sharing files via quick transfer.
- It should also be possible to add those files to a project.
- It should be possible to share project media files via public links to people without Quickbtyte accounts.

For now I'll focus on the last item: sharing project files.
